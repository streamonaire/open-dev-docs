# Testing the Connection

We have built a simple Godot project to help you test connecting to the dedicated server. You can find it in the `TODO: INSERT GIT LINK` repository.

The project does have a Release, if you really prefer it, but we recommend you download the project and open it in Godot. This way you can see how it works and modify it if needed.
