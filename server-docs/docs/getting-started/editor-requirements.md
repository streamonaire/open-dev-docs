# Editor Requirements

The Dedicated Server is built using the Godot Engine. To work with the Dedicated Server, you will need to have the following installed:

- [Godot Engine 4.4.1](https://godotengine.org/download)

That's it.

That's the whole list. This is the only thing we use in the development of the Dedicated Server. We do not use any other tools or libraries, as we don't want to add any unnecessary dependencies to the project.

## Note on Godot Versions

We will always upgrade to the latest stable version of Godot as soon as possible. However, we will not upgrade to a new major version (e.g., Godot 5.x) until it is stable and has been out for a while. This is to ensure that we do not run into any issues with the engine itself.

For example, the 4.5.x release will be releasing soon, we will be upgrading to it as soon as it is stable. However, we will not be upgrading to Godot 5.x until it has been out for a while and is stable.
