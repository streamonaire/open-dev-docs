# Streamonaire Dedicated Server Docs

This contains the main documentation for the Dedicated Server.

This is **not** the API or the Marketing site, those can be found in their respective sections.

## What is the Dedicated Server?

The Dedicated Server is a Godot-based server. It will be specifically be exported to Linux (ARM and AMD64), and Windows (AMD64). The server is designed to be lightweight and efficient, while still being powerful enough to handle a large number of players.

## Why are we making a Dedicated Server?

The Dedicated Server's main goal is to provide a better experience to players. By having a dedicated server, we can ensure, as well as check, a few things:

- When a player goes online
- When a player goes offline
- When a player changes their status
- When a player starts a new game
- When a player answers a question

And much more.

There is also an audience client, that is designed to be used by players who will answer questions, but not host games. It's a web-based client that can be used on any device with a web browser. You can do *ask the audience* helpers, and we'll also have our *audience mode* that will be useful for BRB screens.

## What will these docs contain?

These docs will contain information on how to work with the Dedicated Server, as well as how to set it up and run it. It will also contain information on how to use the API, as well as examples of how to use it.
